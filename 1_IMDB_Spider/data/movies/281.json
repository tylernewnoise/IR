One major threat to their adventure is a detective that's following them. Why? Just as Fogg and Passeportout left London, a major bank was robbed, with Fogg suspected of using the \"around the world\" trip as an excuse to escape.. Their path from London and back includes stops in Paris, Turkey, India, China and USA...",
