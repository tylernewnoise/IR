Because she drinks and smokes too much and has let her appearance go, she suspects her husband is cheating on her. When he suddenly dies, she finds herself buckling in to her controlling sister and mother who push her into initiating a lawsuit she doesn't want to pursue against her husband's doctor and sending her introverted, troubled son to an elite private school he doesn't want to attend. Things get more complicated when she finds her son has told classmates his father is a dead 9-11 hero, and her brother-in-law confesses he's always loved her, not her sister. Laura needs \"a little help\" to deal with her life.
