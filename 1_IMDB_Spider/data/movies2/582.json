Now the woman is ready to fly again. But on her first flight, New is struck by a disturbing feeling of Déjà vu. The plane on which she's working looks familiar, and New realizes that it's actually the same aircraft that crashed ten years ago, though it has been repaired and repainted. New is gripped by terror, but there's nothing she can do because the plane has already taken off, along with the same vengeful spirits that reside in it. Up in the air, the passengers on her plane start to die one at a time & the spirits are determined to take her life this time...
