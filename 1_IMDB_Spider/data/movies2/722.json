Ben and Alan, having bonded for life in helping each other escape unhappy home lives, react differently to Kelsey's situation. One deeply fears the responsibility of looking after a child (having had no personal experiences worth following) while the other finds himself compelled to take him in (seeing himself in the child - an abandoned kid whom no one else wants).
