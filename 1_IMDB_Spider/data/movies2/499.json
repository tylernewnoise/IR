A corrupt judge is about to rule against the expansion of an Indian casino in the Mohave and needs cover: he tells the tribe's chief that the FBI has an undercover agent on the judge's staff, so the expansion must be on hold. The chief hires a hit man to kill the law clerk. The clerk makes a run for it and manages through a series of botched thefts to end up with the bag of money meant for the hit man. A corrupt cop, a degenerate security guard, a hapless bus station clerk, a scheming waitress, and the hit man himself all want the bag - and the chief and the judge want the clerk dead. Is there any way he gets out of the desert alive?
