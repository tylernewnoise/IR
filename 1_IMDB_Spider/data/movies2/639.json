His marginally successful relationships include his grandmother, who keeps him afloat financially, and his best friend Norwood, who provides him with pharmaceuticals. But a chance encounter at a Jiffy Lube gives Larry a beguiling new boss and the impetus to head in another direction for a while. This movie showcases all that may be needed to help a person get unstuck in life: love (or an unrequited crush), friendship (or someone your family likes better than you) and family (or in this case a grandmother who will support you whenever you get fired from a job).","budget":"","gross":"","ratingValue":"5.7","ratingCount":"1,012","duration":"1h 16min","aspectRatio":"","contentRating":"","reviews":"14 user","critics":"30 critic","castList":["Jason Schwartzman","Olympia Dukakis","Tunde Adebimpe","Eleanore Pienta","Stephen Root","Arrow Schwartzman","Jimmy Gonzales","John Gatins","Jonathan Togo","Josh Meyer","Ted Beck","Chris Doubek","Grover Coulson","Alex Karpovsky","Jennifer Prediger"],"characterList":["Larry","Grandma","Major Norwood","Lupe","George","Arrow the Dog","Jimmy","Dinsmore","Don","Reginald","Cashier","Daryl","Mr. Johnson","Kaminsky","Woman with glasses"],"directorList":["Bob Byington"]}]
