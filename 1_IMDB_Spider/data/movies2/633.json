Unfortunately, he never intended to do so. A year later, Frank still has not overcome the problem and tries to commit suicide. At the last Moment, the Devil himself appears and offers him a deal: Frank's soul in exchange for a sinister plot to get Jennifer back. Frank accepts and Mephisto reveals that he is actually Mephisto Jr., and that Frank Faust is a descendant of Doctor Faustus (from the classical play by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe). Therefore, the Mephistos always come to help the Fausts in situations like these. Anyway, Mephisto tries to get Jennifer's attention to focus on Frank by transforming into different local celebrities and showing up on important parties with Faust. Unfortunately, Mephisto Jr. also starts discovering his own sexuality and develops some unpredictable interests, and soon nobody knows what's going on anymore.
