Long-term couple Simon and Jason, along with Cooper and his boytoy du jour, meet annually for a three-day getaway. Looking to spice up the tradition, they add a twist - each invites one attractive, single friend to their mountain retreat. Soon a frisky former college roommate, an often naked yoga instructor, Jason's bashful co-worker and a high-priced rent boy arrive to stir things up. From bedhopping to breakups this is 72 hours they'll never forget.","budget":"","gross":"","ratingValue":"4.8","ratingCount":"743","duration":"1h 24min","aspectRatio":"","contentRating":"","reviews":"7 user","critics":"9 critic","castList":["Chris Carlisle","Joel Harrison","Gaetano Jones","Derek Long","Derek Meeker","Douglas Myers","Daniel Rhyder","Stephen Twardokus"],"characterList":["Mac","Cameron","Kevin","Cooper","Simon","Jason","Andre","Ace"],"directorList":["Rob Williams"]}]
