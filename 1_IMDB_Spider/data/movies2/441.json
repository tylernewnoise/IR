Their new plans hit a few snags when they must deal with their bullying neighbor Rock and Gene's condescending brother Mike, who moves in uninvited after breaking up with his girlfriend. Will their persistence pay off or lead them back to the drawing board? A light-hearted, raunchy comedy movie that's cross between American Pie and Dumb & Dumber.
