Traffic congestion, noise and buses crammed with men and women, this is the usual imagery of a big city on its way to progress. But underneath this cloak of normality, a particular type of crime thrives in the small-scaled world of public transportation, so subtle and elusive to the untrained eye, that seems to be nonexistent. Women of all ages, regardless of their attire, are sexually objectified and abused on a daily basis, tolerating silently the perverted needs of male passengers. How could a woman defend herself from such an assault, shield herself from the anguish and the shame of repeated harassment, when a nation's male population remains untouched by this obscenity?
